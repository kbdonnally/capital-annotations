## Chapter 1: Commodities

### Section 1: The Two Factors of a Commodity: Use-Value and Value (The Substance of Value and the Magnitude of Value)

Page 27:

- Commodities are goods or services that can be bought and sold
- They have both a use-value (what you get out of the commodity; its usefulness to you) and value (expressed through exchange-value, or price)
 
Page 28:
 
 What makes exchange values equal? Take the following commodities that are equal to each other in certain proportions:
 
 A units x commodity = B units y commodity
 
 Or, 1 quarter corn = x cwt of iron
 
According to Marx, this equation "tells us that in two different things"&mdash;the commodities on each side&mdash;"there exists in equal quantities something common to both. The two things must therefore be equal to a third ... Each of them, so far as it is exchange value, must therefore be reducible to this third."

More on this substance:

- "[E]xchange values of commodities must be capable of being expressed in terms of something common to them all, of which thing they represent a greater or less quality."
- This doesn't have anything to do with their use-values; use-values can be exchanged regardless of their function as long as they're in the right proportion (same value)
- Prices do not come out of thin air, essentially; instead, they reflect the amount of *something* common to all commodities

Okay, so use-values of the commodities are out as the common property&mdash;what's left?

&rArr; The answer: Each commodity is the product of *labor*, and more specifically, abstract social labor

- Human labor deposits *value* in the commodities it has worked on
- "But if we abstract from their use value, there remains their Value as defined above. Therefore, the common substance that manifests itself in the exchange value of commodities, whenever they are exchanged, is their value."

Page 29:

- Socially necessary labor time: the average time it takes to produce a commodity as performed by the average worker with normal working conditions and supplies for the time
 - Technological advances continually decrease socially necessary labor time. This is called rising productivity.
 - In a competitive market, a firm cannot afford to take longer than socially necessary on their products or they will go under, because their labor costs will have been higher than all their competitors, who, due to competition, are pricing as low as possible already

Page 30:

Summary on productiveness:

- "In general, the greater the productiveness of labor, the less is the labor time required for the production of an article, the less is the amount of labor crystallized in that article, and the less its value; the *vice versa*, the less the productiveness of labor, the greater is the labor time required for the production of an article, and the greater is its value."

I.e.:

- Productivity: &uarr; &darr;
- Labor: &darr; &uarr;
- Cost: &darr; &uarr;

### Section 2: The Two-fold Character of the Labor Embodied in Commodities

Page 31:

- Remember the planet! &rarr; "[T]he bodies of commodities, are combinations of two elements&mdash; matter and labor. If we take away the useful labor expended upon them, a material substratum is always left, which is furnished by Nature without help of man."

Abstracting human labor power:

- "Productive activity, if we leave out of sight its special form, viz., the useful character of labor, is nothing but the expenditure of human labor power."
- Abstracted labor can be compared

Page 32:

*Note:* for duration of book we will be using only "unskilled, simple labor"; see page 32 for an explanation.

Page 33:

- Human labor power is both abstractly identical to all other human labor power (when forming exchange values) and qualitatively different (when creating different use-values). *This is the two-fold character in question.*

### Section 3: The Form of Value or Exchange-Value

- Since values are only related socially - they're all products of human labor - it "follows as a matter of course, that value can only manifest itself in the social relation of commodity to commodity."
 - The value of an individual commodity is impossible to ascertain without comparing it to another commodity
 
 *Next, we're going to derive money from simple exchange. It gets a little tricky at bits but just take it slow.*
 
 Page 34:
 
 Starting point: "the relation between the values of two commodities supplies us with the simplest expression of the value of a single commodity."
 
 #### A. Elementary or Accidental Form of Value
 
 
 X units of commodity A = Y units commodity B<br/>
 20 yards of linen = 1 coat<br/>
 20 yards of linen are worth 1 coat
 
 - Or, an amount of commodity B is tradable for an amount of commodity A because they are worth the same value
 - x of A = y of B is called the *elementary form* of commodity relations
